<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
<br>To highlight the different menu options, use the ‘up’ and ‘down’ arrow
keys. To adjust a particular selection, use the ‘left’ and ‘right’ arrow
keys. You can always bring up the menu from within the game by pressing
the ‘Esc’ key. To exit a menu at any time, simply press the ‘Esc’ key.</div>

<p><br><b><font size=+1>Ladder</font></b>
<br>In Ladder mode, you will&nbsp; face computer opponents in a challenging
series of levels that will take you through all the different game types.
Only when you defeat the last level can you call yourself a true champion.<b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Quick Game</font></b>
<br>In this mode, you can play a round of any game type. You have the choice
of how many computer opponents to include, as well as which level you would

<div class="MsoNormal"><b><font size=+1></font></b>&nbsp;
<br><b><font size=+1>Multiplayer</font></b>
<br>In Multiplayer mode, you have the ability to play against other people
that have bought Laser Arena, either on a Local Area Network (LAN) or over
the Internet. To play on a LAN, one player needs to select New Game in
the Multiplayer menu to create a game server that others can join. All
the other players then need to select Join Game in the Multiplayer menu,
and then select the appropriate game from the list of LAN games that appear
to join the game.</div>

<div class="MsoNormal">There's two ways to play over the Internet, both
require that you have an Internet connection and be connected to the Internet
at the time. The first (and best) way to play over the Internet is to use
GameSpy. If you don't already have GameSpy, you can install a trial version
using the shortcut added to the Laser Arena start menu group. The second
way requires you to know the Internet IP address of the person who’s game
you wish to connect to (To find your IP Internet address, you can run Laser
Arena and look in the Multiplayer section where it is listed for you).
Then select Join Game, and manually type in the IP Internet address in
the "Join Game At:" box and press Enter.<b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Options</font></b>
<br>The Options menu gives you the ability to adjust various game settings

<p><b><font size=+1>Exit</font></b>
<br>This will quit the game and return you to Windows.</div>


<p class="MsoNormal"><a NAME="Basic Laser Arena Rules"></a><b><u><font size=+2>Basic
Laser Arena Rules</font></u></b>

<p class="MsoNormal">Laser Arena uses rules that are very similar to Laser
Tag. Each player is equipped with a laser gun that is used to tag targets,
laser turrets, and other players.

<p class="MsoNormal">When a player is tagged, they deactivate (can't shoot,
or be tagged) and reactivate after a few seconds, just Laser Tag. Unlike
Laser Tag, though, each player has three energy containers, which are drained
one at a time when tagged. When all of a player's energy containers are
drained, they are considered "tagged out", and are teleported out of the
arena. When tagged out, you are shown the current score board for the game.
You are teleported back into the game when you press you "fire" key or
"jump" key. Careful not to let opponents tag you out too much, because
they get points each time they do.

<p class="MsoNormal">To win each game, your team (or just you in Duel or
Free-For-All) has to accumulate a certain number of points before the opponent
team (player in Duel or Free-For-All) does. The number of points needed
to win is set according to the type of game being played by the game or
the person who started the game.

<p class="MsoNormal">In team games, players win as a team, meaning that
the team score is what matters, not the players' individual scores. Other
players on the same team can not be tagged out by you with your laser blaster,
but you can accidentally tag them out with laser grenades, so make sure
you're careful with them.

<p class="MsoNormal">Points can be earned in several different ways, some
of which are only available in certain game types. Here's a list of all
the various different ways you can get the points you need to beat the
competition.
<ul>
<li class="MsoNormal">
100 points are awarded each time you tag an opponent player, draining one
of their energy containers, and deactivating then for a few seconds.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">
400 points are awarded when you tag out an opponent player, draining their
third and last energy container and causing them to be teleported out of
the arena.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">
In Mega Target, 500 points are awarded for tagging a neutral base target.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">
In Mega Target, 1000 points are awarded for tagging the enemy base target.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">
In Mega Target, 5000 points are awarded for tagging the Mega Target.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">
In Domination, 100 points are awarded for capturing a domination point.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">
In Domination, 100 points are awarded for each domination point you control
each second.</li>
</ul>

<div class="MsoNormal"><a NAME="The Game Screen"></a><b><u><font size=+2>The
Game Screen</font></u></b></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
<br>Throughout the game information will be displayed on your screen that
will let you know how you're doing and what's going on in the game.

<ol>
<li class="MsoNormal">
<b>Energy level</b> – This is represented by three power canisters in the
lower right of your screen. When all the canisters are empty, you will
be transported to your own base in a team game, or to a random point in
the level for a non-team game. Your power canisters are then refilled.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">
<b>Powerup </b>- When you have a power-up, its icon and time remaining
will be displayed just above your energy canisters. When the power-up time
runs out, its display will go away, and you will lose the power-up.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">
<b>Laser Grenades</b> – If you are carrying any laser grenades they will
be displayed as icons along the right side of your screen. The maximum
you can carry is three.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">
<b>Score</b> – Your personal score will be displayed in the top center
of the screen represented by the big number.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">
<b>Points Left</b> - The number of points left to get to win for the player
or team that is in the lead.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">
<b>Team Score</b> – In team games, both team scores will be shown in the
upper left area of the screen, with the winning team on top.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">
<b>Crosshair</b> - The crosshair in the center of the screen will change
to an X shape when you are deactivated. This is usually the easiest way
to tell if you've been hit and are deactivated. While deactivated, your
gun will also lower down and turn off. Remember that while you're deactivated
you can't fire your laser blaster or be tagged.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">
<b>Name Display</b> - When your crosshair passes over another player, their
name will be displayed just below it in a box the color of the team they
are on.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">
<b>Game status</b> – The name of and information about the current game
type is displayed in the lower left of your screen. This information will
be different depending on the game type you are currently playing. In team
games, the backdrop box for the game type name matches the team that you
are on, meaning it's green if you're on the Green team, and red if you're
on the Red team. This makes it easy to always know which team you're on
no matter how chaotic the game gets.</li>

<br><a NAME="Laser Gear"></a><b><u><font size=+2>Laser Gear</font></u></b></div>

<p><br><b><font size=+1>Laser Blaster</font></b>
<br><font size=+0>This is the standard issue Laser Blaster used in the
game of Laser Arena. When fired, it emits a beam of light (default is the
left mouse button to fire). When an opponent (or yourself) is tagged with
the beam, it will drain one canister of their energy. The tagged player
will then power down for a few seconds. In that time they cannot shoot,
or be tagged. After a few seconds, that player will then power back up
and be able to play as normal again. If the player's last canister is drained,
they are teleported out of the arena, and then teleported back in at an
appropriate teleport in location with full energy.</font>
<div class="MsoNormal">When you tag a target, you will see it flash briefly
to show that it was tagged.<b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Laser Grenade</font></b>
<br>When thrown, the Laser Grenade will bounce around a few times before
floating into the air and emitting its barrage of blue lasers. Great care
should be taken when using grenades, as you can accidentally tag yourself,
or your fellow team members if they are hit by it. To use a grenade, press
the grenade key (default is ‘g’).</div>

<div class="MsoNormal"><a NAME="Game Types"></a><b><u><font size=+2>Game
Types</font></u></b></div>

<p><br>There are five different types of games you can play in Laser Arena.
Each has different goals for winning, and different ways to earn the most
points to come out on top.

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size=+1>Free for All</font></b>
<div class="MsoNormal">This is a chaotic everyone-for-themselves match
where your only friend is your laser blaster. All players are red in a
free-for-all, and there are no teams.</div>

<p><br><b><font size=+1>Team Match</font></b>
<div class="MsoNormal">It's a straight out green vs. red tag race as two
teams try to get the most points first by tagging out the opponent team
players.<b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Duel</font></b></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">This is a one-on-one match where you slug it out
with a single opponent to see who can tag the other out the most.</div>

<p><br><b><font size=+1>Domination</font></b>
<div class="MsoNormal">The focus of Domination is the control of three
spots in the map called "domination points". These are captured by a player
walking over one, causing it to turn the color of that player's team. A
captured domination point will give a player's team 100 points each second
that it's controlled by that team. These points can add up very quickly,
making it much more important to control the domination points than to
tag out opponent players.</div>

<p><br><b><font size=+1>Mega Target</font></b>
<div class="MsoNormal">Each map is made of four bases (two neutral, and
one for each team) and a central room containing the Mega Target. The objective
is to tag the two targets in each of the two neutral bases, and the target
in the enemy base, which grants you "Mega Target Ability" for 45 seconds.
You then have to get to the central room and hit the Mega Target before
you're either tagged out, or run out of time. With the Mega Target giving
you 5000 points each time you tag it, the main objectives in Mega Target
matches is not only to hit the three needed targets and the the Mega Target,
but also to prevent the opponent players from do the same thing. Each time
a player gets Mega Target Ability, you will hear "red team, Mega Target"
of "green team, Mega Target" depending on which team got it. If it's your
task to stop opponents from scoring too many points, this is you cue to
head towards the central room and try to stop them from scoring the 5000
point tag on the Mega Target.

<div class="MsoNormal"><a NAME="Tips from the designers"></a><b><u><font size=+2>Tips
from the designers</font></u></b></div>

<ul>
<li class="MsoNormal">
Constantly move. A moving target is always more difficult to hit.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">
Grab power-ups, gameplay tends to revolve around control of the power-ups.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">
Be cautious with grenades, you can hurt yourself and your teammates with
them.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">
Always beware of the turrets in Mega Target games.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">
Make sure to listen. Sounds you hear in the game can tip you off to what's
going on before you can actually see what's going on.</li>
